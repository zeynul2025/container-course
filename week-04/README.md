# Week 4: Kubernetes Architecture & Your First Deployment

## Overview

**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Format:** Lecture + Hands-on Labs  

Everything you built in Weeks 1-3 has been leading here. You containerized an application, optimized the image, orchestrated multiple services with Compose. Now the question is: how does this work when you have 50 containers across 10 machines instead of 3 containers on your laptop?

The answer is Kubernetes. And here's the thing—your Week 1 apps? They've been running on a Kubernetes cluster this entire time. Today we pull back the curtain.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this class, you will be able to:

1. Diagram the Kubernetes control plane and explain the role of each component (API server, etcd, scheduler, controller manager, kubelet)
2. Explain the desired state → actual state reconciliation loop that makes Kubernetes self-healing
3. Create and manage Pods, Deployments, and Services using `kubectl`
4. Perform rolling updates and explain how Kubernetes rolls out changes without downtime
5. Debug failing pods using `kubectl logs`, `kubectl describe`, `kubectl exec`, and cluster events

---

## Pre-Class Setup

### Local Cluster with kind

You need a local Kubernetes cluster for experimentation. We use **kind** (Kubernetes IN Docker) because it runs K8s nodes as Docker containers — you already have Docker, so this just works.

**In Codespaces:** kind is already installed in your devcontainer.

**On your VM:**

```bash
# Install kind
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.31.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind

# Install kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

**Verify:**

```bash
kind version
kubectl version --client
```

### Shared Cluster Access

You'll connect to the shared production cluster using `cloudflared` (a Cloudflare Tunnel proxy) and OIDC authentication via your GitHub account. Both tools are pre-installed in the devcontainer.

See [Lab 1, Part 3](./labs/lab-01-kind-cluster/) for the full setup steps. You'll use two contexts throughout this course: your local kind cluster for experimentation, and the shared cluster to see your production deployments.

## The Two-Cluster Model

This is how we work for the rest of the course:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     LOCAL CLUSTER (kind)        │     │     SHARED CLUSTER (Talos)      │

│                                 │     │                                 │
│  "dev"                          │     │  "prod"                         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────────────────┘
         ▲                                         ▲
         │                                         │
    You run kubectl                          Git push triggers
    directly here                            ArgoCD sync here
```

This mirrors how real teams work. Developers don't `kubectl apply` to production. They push code, and a pipeline handles deployment. Your local cluster is where you learn the mechanics. The shared cluster is where your work goes live.

## Key Concepts

### Why Not Just Docker Compose in Production?

Docker Compose is great for your laptop. But in production you need answers to questions Compose can't handle:

- **What happens when a container crashes at 3 AM?** Compose won't restart it unless you configure restart policies, and even then it's only on the same machine.
- **What happens when a machine dies?** Compose doesn't know about other machines.
- **How do you update without downtime?** Compose tears down the old container and starts a new one. Users see an error page.
- **How do you scale to handle a traffic spike?** You'd manually edit the compose file and re-run it.

Kubernetes handles all of this automatically. You declare what you want, and it makes it happen.

### The Kubernetes Architecture

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**API Server** — The front door to everything. Every `kubectl` command, every internal component, talks to the API server. It validates requests and writes to etcd.

**etcd** — The cluster's memory. A distributed key-value store that holds all cluster state: what pods should exist, what nodes are available, what configs are set. If etcd is lost, the cluster has amnesia.

**Scheduler** — The placement engine. When a new pod needs to run, the scheduler decides which node has the resources and meets the constraints. It doesn't run the pod — it just assigns it.

**Controller Manager** — The enforcer. Runs control loops that constantly compare desired state (what you asked for) with actual state (what's running). If a pod dies and you said you want 3 replicas, the controller creates a replacement.

**kubelet** — The node agent. Runs on every worker node. Receives instructions from the API server ("run this pod"), manages containers through the container runtime, and reports status back.

### The Reconciliation Loop

This is the most important concept in Kubernetes:

```
You declare:  "I want 3 replicas of my app"
                    │
                    ▼
            ┌───────────────┐
            │  Desired State │  ← Stored in etcd
            │  replicas: 3   │
            └───────┬───────┘
                    │
          Controller compares
                    │
            ┌───────▼───────┐
            │  Actual State  │  ← What's running right now
            │  replicas: 2   │
            └───────┬───────┘
                    │
             Drift detected!
                    │
                    ▼
         Controller creates 1 pod
         to reconcile the difference
```

This loop runs constantly. If a pod crashes, the actual state changes and the controller fixes it. If you update the desired state (change the image tag), the controller rolls out the change. You never tell Kubernetes *how* to do something — you tell it *what you want* and it figures out how to get there.

### Core Objects: Pod → Deployment → Service

**Pod** — The smallest deployable unit. One or more containers that share networking and storage. In practice, most pods run a single container. You rarely create pods directly.

**Deployment** — Manages a set of identical pods. You say "I want 3 pods running my image" and the Deployment's controller (ReplicaSet) makes it happen. Handles rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling.

**Service** — A stable network endpoint for a set of pods. Pods are ephemeral — they get new IPs when they restart. A Service provides a consistent DNS name and IP that routes traffic to healthy pods using label selectors.

```
                    ┌──────────────────┐
                    │     Service      │
                    │  "my-app-svc"    │
                    │  ClusterIP:      │
                    │  10.96.45.12     │
                    └────────┬─────────┘
                             │
              selector: app=my-app
                             │
            ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
            │                │                │
      ┌─────▼─────┐   ┌─────▼─────┐   ┌─────▼─────┐
      │   Pod 1   │   │   Pod 2   │   │   Pod 3   │
      │ my-app    │   │ my-app    │   │ my-app    │
      │ 10.244.1.5│   │10.244.2.8 │   │10.244.1.9 │
      └───────────┘   └───────────┘   └───────────┘

      Labels: app=my-app on all three
```

### From Compose to Kubernetes — Concept Mapping

If you're thinking "this feels familiar," it should:

| Docker Compose | Kubernetes | What It Does |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| `services:` block | Deployment + Service | Defines your application |
| `image:` | Pod spec `.containers[].image` | Which container to run |
| `ports:` | Service `ports:` | How to reach the app |
| `replicas:` (v3) | `spec.replicas:` | How many copies |
| `restart: always` | Built into Deployments | Self-healing |
| `depends_on:` | No equivalent (by design) | Startup ordering |
| `volumes:` | PersistentVolumeClaim | Persistent storage |
| `environment:` | `env:` / ConfigMap / Secret | Configuration |

The biggest shift: Compose is imperative ("run these containers in this order"), Kubernetes is declarative ("here's what I want — you figure it out").

## Discovery Questions

Answer these in your own words after completing the labs:

1. You deleted a pod with `kubectl delete pod <name>`. It came back. Why? What would you need to delete to make it stay gone?

2. Your Deployment has `replicas: 3` but you only see 2 pods running. Where do you look first? Name three `kubectl` commands that would help you investigate.

3. You update your Deployment image from `:v1` to `:v2`. Kubernetes doesn't delete all pods and recreate them — it does something smarter. What is it, and why?

4. A Service selects pods with the label `app: my-app`. You have 5 pods but only 3 have that label. How many pods receive traffic? What happens to the other 2?

5. What's the difference between a pod's IP address and a Service's ClusterIP? Which one should other applications use to connect, and why?
